<!--title:Dynamic Code Generation and Compilation-->

While most folks will probably use Lamar as an IoC container tool, you can also use the underlying
code generation and compilation support all by itself. The [Jasper application framework](https://jasperfx.github.io)
heavily uses this capability as its ["Special Sauce"](https://jeremydmiller.com/2018/01/16/introducing-bluemilk-structuremaps-replacement-jaspers-special-sauce/) (Lamar was originally built
under the project name "BlueMilk"). See also [Roslyn Powered Code Weaving Middleware](https://jeremydmiller.com/2018/05/16/roslyn-powered-code-weaving-middleware/) for more information about how Jasper
uses Lamar for its efficient middleware strategy.
